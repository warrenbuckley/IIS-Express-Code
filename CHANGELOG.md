# Changelog
## Version 1.1.2

## Version 1.1.1
* **Bug Fix:** Fix issue where the site could not be restarted and required users to close VSCode to start the site up again

## Version 1.1.0
* **New:** Adds a new feature where IIS Express can be auto installed - by downloading the MSI from Microsoft & installing it for you when IIS is not detected

## Version 1.0.0
* **New:** `.vscode/iisexpress.json` now supports a new property `protocol` which is an optional property & allows you to set the protocol to either `http` or `https` By default this is set to `http` If you do use `https` then IIS Express expects the port number to be within a range of 44300 - 44399
* **New:** Uses `ApplicationHost.config` allowing for common changes for all sites running IIS Express. This allows support for using PHP for example.

### PHP Support
If you wish to use PHP then you will need to install PHP for Windows and then use the following commands in the console

**NOTE:** This alternatively may be `\Program Files (x86)\IIS Express\`
```
cd "c:\Program files\IIS Express\"
```

**NOTE:** The path to `php-cgi.exe` may be different for you so update the two commands below.

```
appcmd set config /section:system.webServer/fastCGI /+[fullPath='"C:\Program Files (x86)\P  HP\php-cgi.exe"']

appcmd set config /section:system.webServer/handlers /+[name='PHP_via_FastCGI',path='*.php',verb='*',modules='FastCgiModule',scriptProcessor='"C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\php-cgi.exe"',resourceType='Unspecified']

appcmd set config /section:system.webServer/defaultDocument /+"files.[value='index.php']"
```
